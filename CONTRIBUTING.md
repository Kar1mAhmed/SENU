Welcome to the team! To keep our project clean, organized, and easy to manage, please follow these guidelines.

## Golden Rules

1.  **Follow the Design System:** Use the predefined colors, fonts, and spacing from `tailwind.config.ts`.
2.  **Create Reusable Components:** Build components to be modular and reusable. Place them in `src/components`.
3.  **Keep it Organized:** Place new styles in `src/styles`, new components in `src/components`, and static assets in `public`.
4.  **Write Clear Code:** Keep your code readable, well-commented, and concise.

## UI Components

-   All UI components should be built with reuse in mind.
-   Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling.
-   Components should be placed in their own folder within `src/components`, e.g., `src/components/Button/index.tsx`.
